This is a fork of Jason Gauci's HyperNEAT repo. Specifically it is intended to apply HyperNEAT to the problem of playing general Atari games.

INSTALLATION:

1) The ALE submodule must first be checked out. From the HyperNEAT directory run the command:

git submodule init

followed by:

git submodule update

This should populate the ALE submodule.

2) There is a build script included which gives a rough sense of the build process. The individual components built by this script will require user input for cmake options. I believe all the defaults are configured correctly so the user can simply press ENTER through all the options.


REQUIREMENTS:

1) Several libraries are required including: SDL, SDL graphics, SDL image, boost, boost thread, boost serialization, boost system, and boost filesystem.

2) ROM files for the games are not provided due to copyright issues. Check Atari enthusiast websites.

3) Image files for manual object detection are not included. These may be generated through the ALE codebase.
