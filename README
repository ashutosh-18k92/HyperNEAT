This is a fork of Jason Gauci's HyperNEAT repo. Specifically it is intended to apply HyperNEAT to the problem of playing general Atari games.

INSTALLATION:

1) The ALE submodule must first be checked out. From the HyperNEAT directory run the command:

git submodule init

followed by:

git submodule update

This should populate the ALE submodule.

2) There is a build script included which gives a rough sense of the build process. The individual components built by this script will require user input for cmake options. I believe all the defaults are configured correctly so the user can simply press ENTER through all the options.
