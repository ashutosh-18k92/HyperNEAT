    abstract = {{An important feature of many problem domains in machine learning is their geometry. For example, adjacency relationships, symmetries, and Cartesian coordinates are essential to any complete description of board games, visual recognition, or vehicle control. Yet many approaches to learning ignore such information in their representations, instead inputting flat parameter vectors with no indication of how those parameters are situated geometrically. This paper argues that such geometric information is critical to the ability of any machine learning approach to effectively generalize; even a small shift in the configuration of the task in space from what was experienced in training can go wholly unrecognized unless the algorithm is able to learn the regularities in decision-making across the problem geometry. To demonstrate the importance of learning from geometry, three variants of the same evolutionary learning algorithm (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies), whose representations vary in their capacity to encode geometry, are compared in checkers. The result is that the variant that can learn geometric regularities produces a significantly more general solution. The conclusion is that it is important to enable machine learning to detect and thereby learn from the geometry of its problems.}},

@inproceedings{ambrosio08,
    abstract = {{This paper argues that multiagent learning is a potential "killer application" for generative and developmental systems (GDS) because key challenges in learning to coordinate a team of agents are naturally addressed through indirect encodings and information reuse. For example, a significant problem for multiagent learning is that policies learned separately for different agent roles may nevertheless need to share a basic skill set, forcing the learning algorithm to reinvent the wheel for each agent. GDS is a good match for this kind of problem because it specializes in ways to encode patterns of related yet varying motifs. In this paper, to establish the promise of this capability, the Hypercube-based NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (HyperNEAT) generative approach to evolving neurocontrollers learns a set of coordinated policies encoded by a  single  genome representing a team of predator agents that work together to capture prey. Experimental results show that it is not only possible, but beneficial to encode a heterogeneous team of agents with an indirect encoding. The main contribution is thus to open up a significant new application domain for GDS.}},
